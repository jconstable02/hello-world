"begin new edit"~10-6-2018--Saturday,3:21a.m.
This is the edit to the edited version of my original # hello-world file i posted in April. That file (the edited version of my original)was pulled and even verified by someone else, surely the same character who compromised my devices, accounts,along with everything internet/digital. 
This will now be a timestamp for when I discovered this account has been copromised."end new edit"
this edit serves as my first edit of the READ.md file branch of hello-world.
